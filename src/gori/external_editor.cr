    # that genuinely ends in CRLF came back two bytes shorter and the declared
    # `Content-Length: 34` no longer matched the 32 bytes sent — the exact desync a smuggling
    # test is trying to CAUSE deliberately, arriving by accident.

    # globally: for a wire kind the strip is CONDITIONAL on the original not having ended in a
    # newline, which is precisely "remove what the editor's ensure-newline-at-EOF added, and
    # nothing else". Removing the strip outright would have been the mirror-image defect —

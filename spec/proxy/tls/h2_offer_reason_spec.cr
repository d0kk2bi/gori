# R5-F3. An h2/gRPC client whose preface lands on the HTTP/1.1 path is refused, and the refusal
# used to hard-code two causes ("settings network.http2 is \"off\" or a Match&Replace body rule
# is live") and point at a `gori.log` line that names which. Two things went stale under that
# reasoning: `h2_candidate?` has FOUR downgrade branches now, and — decisively — the common case
# is NONE of them. The tunnel offered h2, the ORIGIN answered `http/1.1` at ALPN,
# `notice_downgrade` never ran, and `gori.log` stayed 0 bytes. The operator was told to change a
# setting that was already correct and to read a line that did not exist.

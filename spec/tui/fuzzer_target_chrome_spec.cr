# The Fuzzer's TARGET border carries two things on its right: the mode chip `Frame` draws, and
# an `SNI` marker shown when an override is set. The marker used to place itself at
# `rect.right - size - 1` — inside the mode chip's own cells — so setting an override painted
# over the right of ` ↵:READ ` and left `↵: SNI ` on the border. The hit-test still measured
# the whole mode rect underneath, so a press on the letters an operator could SEE saying SNI
# toggled insert mode.
#
# Repeater met this first and chained the marker left of the chip instead
# (`repeater_view.cr#target_chrome_chain`, whose comment describes exactly this). These pin
# the ported fix in both halves — what is drawn, and what a press does — and locate the marker
# by READING the rendered row rather than by asking the view, so a geometry that renders one
# way and hit-tests another cannot satisfy both examples.
